# Configuration Guide

Before starting it's worth noting that currently there are two networks in Lacchain:

- Lacchain Mainnet
- Lacchain Open-protestnet

To start using this repo you will need to configure hardhat.config.ts file, you can just start with the following command:

```sh
cp hardhat.config.example hardhat.config.ts
```

Basically `hardhat.config.example` will set up the default configuration to point to Lacchain Open-protestnet

You can configure the hardhat files to deploy the contracts on any EVM compatible network.
